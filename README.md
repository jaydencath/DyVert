## Description 
>The motivation for DyVert derives from a lack of media search instruments that accurately cater to the interest of the consumer. With this app, our goals are to broaden the client's media/ entertainment palette and showcase the content of our creators to new consumers who share a common interest. DyVert could be the solution to many problems that modern media platforms face: keeping the consumer engaged and refreshed with multimedia content with an innovative method and shedding light on more upcoming creators to support their art.

__Application or web service__  <br>
<br>
Our service will take place as an app, giving users easier access to our platform. Dyverse will be taking place as an application giving it options to be downloadable on multiple platforms and have its services be handmade for its own specific experience outside of website interactions. 

__Features of DyVerse__ <br>
<br>
Our app will provide features that are simplistic but also engaging to the point where the whole experience we provide is enticing. We will allow users to swipe on types of content and entertainment to build their “entertaste”. A user's “entertaste” is essentially the data that helps us know what content they engage with and what entertainment they choose to consume their preferred content. Another feature we will provide is for users to add their own content to our platform, which eventually shows up on other users' timeline based on their matches. 

__What's the selling point of DyVerse__ <br>
<br>
The selling point of our app is to essentially give users a social platform that lets them share, create, and organize the content they view and engage with. In today's day and age entertainment and content is in a surplus. We have tiktok, instagram, magazines, youtube, blogs, podcasts, books, and so on. We want to give our users the experience that also lets them feel more conscious about their content and lets them engage with it alongside other users. Organization is so important in today's day and age and we hope to give users a good grasp of organization, community, and engagement with their favorite creators, content, and entertainment.
