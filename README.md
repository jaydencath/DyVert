## Description 
>The motivation for DyVert derives from a lack of media search instruments that accurately cater to the interest of the consumer. With this app, our goals are to broaden the client's media/ entertainment palette and showcase the content of our creators to new consumers who share a common interest. DyVert could be the solution to many problems that modern media platforms face: keeping the consumer engaged and refreshed with multimedia content with an innovative method and shedding light on more upcoming creators to support their art.
