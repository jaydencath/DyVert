## Description 
>The motivation for DyVert derives from a lack of media search instruments that accurately cater to the interest of the consumer. With this app, our goals are to broaden the client's media/ entertainment palette and showcase the content of our creators to new consumers who share a common interest.

>Our service will take place as a web app, giving users easy access to our platform. The user will be able to swipe (DyVert) items left or right based on if they are interested in the item and want to save them, or if they are not interested. The selling point of our app is to essentially give users a social platform that lets them find and save items that they may want to look into based on a preview shown on a content card.

>Other users will include admins who can monitor posts. They will be able to flag and delete content cards. They will also be able to delete posts. Another user will be the creator/curator who can create content cards and edit those cards for the regular user.
